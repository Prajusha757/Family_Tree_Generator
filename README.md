# 🌳 Family Tree Generator

The **Family Tree Generator** is a data structure-based mini project that visualizes and manages family relationships using tree traversal concepts.  
Built as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** curriculum, it demonstrates the practical use of **trees, recursion, and depth-first traversal (DFS)** to represent and navigate hierarchical data efficiently.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Family relationships often form a naturally hierarchical structure, making the **tree data structure** an ideal way to represent them.  
This project allows users to:
- Create a family tree interactively,
- Add new family members dynamically,
- Display the entire hierarchy clearly, and
- Search or trace relationships between members.

It bridges the gap between **theoretical tree concepts** and **real-world applications** like genealogy systems and social network modeling.

## ✨ Key Features

- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Dynamic Tree Creation:** Add family members at any generation level.  
- 🔍 **Search Functionality:** Find members quickly using recursive traversal.  
- 🌿 **Hierarchy Visualization:** Display relationships with proper indentation and symbols.  
- 🔁 **Recursive Traversal:** Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all connections.  
- ⚙️ **Efficient Linking:** Maintains parent-child references using dictionary mapping.  
- 💾 **Simple Interface:** Command-line or menu-based interaction for easy use and clarity.

## 🧩 Data Structures & Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tree Data Structure** | Used to represent hierarchical family relationships. |
| **Recursion** | For traversing and printing members at all levels. |
| **Depth-First Search (DFS)** | To explore the tree structure efficiently. |
| **Dictionary / Map** | For maintaining quick lookups of parent-child relationships. |
| **Dynamic Node Insertion** | Allows adding new members at any generation dynamically. |

## 🧮 Algorithm Explanation

1. **Tree Node Representation:**  
   Each family member is represented as a node containing:
   - Name of the person  
   - List of children (as nodes)  

2. **Adding Members:**  
   The `addMember(parentName, childName)` function searches the tree recursively for the parent node.  
   Once found, the new child node is appended to the parent’s list of children.

3. **Displaying the Tree:**  
   A recursive `displayTree(node, level)` function is used.  
   - Indentation (`--` or spaces) represents generation depth.  
   - Each recursive call prints one level of the hierarchy.  

4. **Searching Members:**  
   A DFS-based `searchMember(node, name)` recursively traverses nodes to locate a family member and returns their position or relationship.

## 💻 Implementation Summary

- The project is developed in **Python / C++ / Java** (as per your version).  
- The core logic is modular, separating:
  - **Tree creation**
  - **Member addition**
  - **Display and search operations**  
- Efficient use of recursion ensures that even large family trees can be displayed and managed easily.
